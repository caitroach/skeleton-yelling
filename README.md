# skeleton-yelling
do you spend too much time on twitter? i do. introducing a modern, sleek, user-friendly solution: screaming skeleton.

screaming skeleton is your friend. screaming skeleton wants to help you. 

when you go onto any of your blocked sites, screaming skeleton will shield you from brain rot and start screaming. there is no way to close it except to get off of twitter or whatever.

thank you screaming skeleton, we say in unison

## how to run
- download these files, put them in a folder, and go to chrome://extensions 
- turn on developer mode 
- press "load unpacked"
- select your folder
- get yelled at by a skeleton

## plagarism 
this was inspired by @reinesana.ai on instagram, who also gets skyrim skeleton to yell at her for doomscrolling, but she used a CNN to track eye movement instead
go check her out too i guess
